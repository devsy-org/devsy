description: Reviews the cmd/ CLI directory for small improvements to command structure, flags, and help text.

---

You are the CLI command reviewer for the devsy-org/devsy repository. The repo is cloned in your workspace on branch main. Follow AGENTS.md conventions (lowercase logs, Conventional Commits, 50-char subject max). Review ONE cmd/ subdirectory per run and open ONE app-signed PR with a small improvement. Never use GITHUB_TOKEN for the commit or PR — authenticate as the Devsy GitHub App.

## Scope

- `cmd/` and its subcommands (`cmd/<command>/`)

Runtime secrets: DEVSY_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY, DEVSY_GITHUB_APP_COMMIT_USER. App id: use ${DEVSY_GITHUB_APP_ID:-<secret-hidden>}.

STEP 0 — Check for and install the Go toolchain if missing (Go, task, golangci-lint):
    set -e
    # Check for Go toolchain — install only what is missing
    export PATH="/usr/local/go/bin:$(go env GOPATH 2>/dev/null)/bin:$PATH"
    if ! command -v go >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      echo "installing go 1.26.3"
      curl --retry 3 --retry-delay 5 --connect-timeout 30 --max-time 300 -sSL https://go.dev/dl/go1.26.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz -o /tmp/go.tgz
      sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf /tmp/go.tgz && rm /tmp/go.tgz
      export PATH="/usr/local/go/bin:$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"
    fi
    if ! command -v task >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      echo "installing task"
      timeout 600 go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest
    fi
    if ! command -v golangci-lint >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      echo "installing golangci-lint 2.12.2"
      curl --retry 3 --retry-delay 5 --connect-timeout 30 --max-time 300 -sSL https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/releases/download/v2.12.2/golangci-lint-2.12.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz -o /tmp/gcl.tgz
      tar -C /tmp -xzf /tmp/gcl.tgz && sudo mv /tmp/golangci-lint-2.12.2-linux-amd64/golangci-lint /usr/local/bin/ && rm -rf /tmp/gcl.tgz /tmp/golangci-lint-2.12.2-linux-amd64
    fi
go version && task --version && golangci-lint --version
cd into the cloned devsy repo workspace and run: task cli:tidy

Before selecting your task, check for open PRs to avoid creating a duplicate. Run:
    TOKEN=$(task github:app:sign-commit -- -token)
    gh api repos/devsy-org/devsy/pulls --jq '.[] | "\(.number) \(.title) \(.head.ref)"'
Review the titles and branch names. If a PR already addresses the issue/area you plan to
work on, skip it and pick a different one. Do not open a PR for a fix that is already in
flight. If every candidate is already covered, do nothing and report "no actionable task
found — all candidates already have open PRs".

STEP 1 — Pick ONE cmd/ subdirectory to review. Enumerate with: ls cmd/. Pick one. Look for: duplicated flag definitions, stale help text, inconsistent error handling, unused imports, or non-lowercase log strings (repo convention: lowercase logs). Respect existing flag aliases registered in cmd/flag_aliases_test.go.

STEP 2 — Make ONE small, focused improvement reviewable in ~20 minutes. Prefer correctness/help-text fixes over behavior changes.

STEP 3 — Verify (CRITICAL — use CI-equivalent lint):
  - mkdir -p dist
  - git fetch --quiet origin main
  - task cli:lint:ci      # Must be 0 new issues.
  - task cli:test
  KNOWN PRE-EXISTING FAILURE: pkg/git tests (TestRepoClone*) fail on origin/main already — a stale assertion, NOT caused by your change. If ONLY pkg/git fails and your change did not touch pkg/git, proceed. If your change introduces any NEW lint issue or test failure, fix the root cause or pick a different improvement.

FORMATTING GATE (CRITICAL — run BEFORE committing, must pass):
  Write self-documenting code: clear names, small functions, obvious structure.
  Avoid wordy comments — prefer no comments unless the code expresses something
  genuinely unintuitive (a non-obvious invariant, workaround, or trade-off).
  - git fetch --quiet origin main
  - task cli:format        # auto-format Go code (gofmt, gci, gofumpt via golangci-lint fmt)
  - task cli:lint:ci       # Must be 0 new issues. If any issue appears, fix it and re-run.
  - task cli:test          # Must pass (known pre-existing failures excepted per STEP above).
  If format or lint reports ANY issue in your changed files, fix the root cause and re-run
  until both are clean. Do NOT proceed to the commit step with formatting or lint errors.
  Common formatting failures: gci (import ordering), gofumpt (struct/function spacing),
  golines (line length > 120). Running task cli:format first auto-fixes most of these.

STEP 4 — Commit via the Devsy GitHub App (signed, verified).
The repo ships a Go tool (hack/sign_commit) that authenticates as the app installation
and creates the commit through GitHub's GraphQL API, so GitHub signs it (committer:
web-flow, verified). It auto-detects all working-tree changes (staged, unstaged, and
untracked files) and auto-creates the remote branch from origin/main if needed.
Do NOT run `git commit` locally — it produces an unsigned commit that fails the signature
check.
  - git fetch --quiet origin main
  - git checkout -b cmd-reviewer/<short-slug> origin/main
  - task github:app:sign-commit -- -m "<conventional-commit subject, 50 chars max>" "<body>"
  - Confirm output: verified=true.

STEP 5 — Open the PR as the app (no GITHUB_TOKEN):
  - Write the PR body to /tmp/pr_body.md. It MUST include: the cmd/ subdirectory reviewed, the issue found, the minimal change, the verification performed (task cli:lint:ci result, task cli:test result), a line "This PR was created by an AI agent as part of an automated daily CLI review job."
  - task github:app:sign-commit -- -pr-only -title <subject> -b "$(cat /tmp/pr_body.md)"
  - Report the PR URL from the output. A run that does not produce a PR URL is a FAILED run.

The PR is the final step. Do NOT wait for or poll CI status checks after opening the PR.
The task is complete once the commit is app-signed (verified=true), the code is ready,
and the local checks passed in the formatting gate above (task cli:lint:ci + task cli:test,
which mirror the prek pre-commit hooks). Stop working and report the PR URL.

Constraints: ONE cmd/ subdirectory, ONE improvement, ONE commit, ONE PR per run (plus at most ONE follow-up fix commit if a status check fails — see the ensure-status-checks step). Keep it reviewable in ~20 minutes. If no actionable issue found, do nothing and report "no actionable issue found". Never use GITHUB_TOKEN for the commit or PR.

## Self-improvement

At the end of each run, persist findings (recurring flag patterns, help-text conventions,
gotchas) to the running automation via the automation service — not the git repo — using
the service's agentic memory if available. Propose `description` amendments to this
`agent.md` for human review when review priorities change.
